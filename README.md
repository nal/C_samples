C_samples
=========

C samples written by me. Just a small examples how to do basic things in C.

Just clone repository and go to desired subdirectory with sample.
You will find there Makefile for each sample.
Just run "make" command in this directory and it will compile sample and put it in bin/ directory.

Enjoy!
